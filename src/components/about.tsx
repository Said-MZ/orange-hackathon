        In response to the escalating demand for skilled programmers within both
        local and regional markets, Orange Jordan has steadfastly committed
        itself to nurturing a new generation proficient in these crucial skills.
        The Coding Academy by Orange, inaugurated in June 2019, in collaboration
        with Simplon.co, embarked on its mission to provide comprehensive,
        tuition-free 6-month training courses in coding languages, complemented
        by a month-long internship within tech and tech-enabled companies. Each
        year, students are selected to join the Academy through a competitive
        admissions process. Building on its initial success, our coding academy
        graduates now boast an impressive 85% employment rate across all
        cohorts. This affirms the efficiency of the academys teaching
        methodology, curricula, and academic staff. Moreover, the academy has
        expanded across the kingdoms governorates. It has established academies
        in Irbid, Zarqa, Balqa, and Aqaba, further extending its impact and
        accessibility.
